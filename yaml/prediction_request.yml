        documents: [{"id":"1","text":"Like most recipes, the origins of the dish are obscure but there are many legends. As 'carbonara' literally means 'coal miner's wife', some believe that the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian coal miners. Others say that it was originally made over charcoal grills, or that it was made with squid ink, giving it the color of coal. It has even been suggested that it was created by, or as a tribute to, the charcoalmen, a secret society prominent in the unification of Italy. Also, the name may be from a Roman restaurant named Carbonara. The dish is not present in Ada Boni's 1927 classic La Cucina Romana, and is unrecorded before the Second World War. It was first recorded after the war as a Roman dish, when many Italians were eating eggs and bacon supplied by American troops.\nIngredients\n-spaghetti: 450g (1 pound)\n-pancetta: 225g (\\u00bd pound)\n-egg yolks: 5\n-Pecorino Romano cheese: 178 ml (3/4 cup)\n-Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese: 178 ml (3/4 cup)\n-olive oil, extra-virgin: 3-4 tablespoons\n-pepper, freshly ground: \\u00bd tablespoon\n-salt,"},{"id":"2","text":"The dish forms part of a family of dishes involving pasta with bacon, cheese and pepper, one of which is pasta alla gricia. Indeed, it is very similar to pasta cacio e uova, a dish dressed with melted lard and a mixture of eggs and cheese, which is documented as long ago as 1839, and, according to some researchers and older Italians, may have been the pre-Second World War name of carbonara. Spaghetti alla carbonara. There are many theories for the origin of the name carbonara, which is likely more recent than the dish itself. Since the name is derived from carbonaro (the Italian word for 'charcoal burner'), some believe the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian charcoal workers. In parts of the United States, this etymology gave rise to the term \"coal miner's spaghetti\". It has even been suggested that it was created as a tribute to the Carbonari ('charcoalmen') secret society prominent in the early, repressed stages of Italian unification in the early 19th century. It seems more likely that it is an \"urban dish\" from Rome, perhaps popularized by the Roman restaurant of the same name. The names pasta alla carbonara and spaghetti alla carbonara are unrecorded before the Second World War; notably, it is absent from Ada Boni's 1930 La Cucina Romana ('Roman cuisine'). The carbonara name is first attested in 1950, when it was described in the Italian newspaper La Stampa as a dish sought by the American officers after the Allied liberation of Rome in 1944. It was described as a \"Roman dish\" at a time when many Italians were eating eggs and bacon supplied by troops from the United States. In 1954, it was included in Elizabeth David's Italian Food, an English-language cookbook published in Great Britain.Ingredients: 100g pancetta, 50g pecorino cheese, 50g parmesan, 3 large eggs, 350g spaghetti, 2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole, 50g unsalted butter, sea salt and freshly grated black pepper"}]
