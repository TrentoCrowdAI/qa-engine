As 'carbonara' literally means 'coal miner's wife', some believe that the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian coal miners. Others say that it was originally made over charcoal grills, or that it was made with squid ink, giving it the color of coal. It has even been suggested that it was created by, or as a tribute to, the charcoalmen, a secret society prominent in the unification of Italy. Also, the name may be from a Roman restaurant named Carbonara. The dish is not present in Ada Boni's 1927 classic La Cucina Romana, and is unrecorded before the Second World War.
